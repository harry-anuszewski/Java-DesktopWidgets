CS338 Project

## About
This is a project that I worked on at Drexel University in class CS338. The point of this project was to create an interface similar to the Mac OSX dashboard. I wanted to be able to see and use widgets on any OS. This was a fun project and I will be starting it up again to finish where I left off.

## Current Widgets
* Clock
* Weather

## Widgets to come
* Calendar
* Notepad
* Calculator
* Cpu/ram tracker

### Weather Widget
This widget uses [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/). You will need to goto the site and sign up for an API key. It's free. Set api_key in WeatherWidget.java.
